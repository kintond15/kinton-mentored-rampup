        <p>For a week straight, I battled demons in my head trying to figure out the perfect rankings for the top ten 
        NBA players of all time. There are players that 100% deserve a spot, but unfortunately, there will also be amazing players 
        left out no matter what. So, I also added an honorable mention page to include amazing players.</p>
